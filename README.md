## Running the Extension

To run the extension, you first need to start the server on your machine.

```
 uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 
```

and now you are set to use it

### Notes

- This app performs optimally using **CUDA**. While it can run on a CPU, please note that in this case, it won‚Äôt stream the text in real-time. Instead, it will process the entire text first and then play it all at once.

  To add your own voices , you  have to :

1. **Add Your Voice File**\
   Place a `.wav` file of approximately 6 seconds in the `voices` folder.
2. **Update** `model.py`\
   Add your voice to the `voices` dictionary in `model.py`. It should look like this:

   ```
   voices = { "name" : "voices/name.wav"}
   ```
3. **Update** `popup.html`\
   Add an option for your voice in the `popup.html` file. Ensure the `value` matches the `"name"` used in `model.py`:

   ```html
   <option value="name">name</option>
   ```
4. **Refresh the Extension**\
   Go to `chrome://extensions` and refresh your extension to see the new voice option.![refresh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb99705a-27cc-4448-bd08-a555d32a7b61)
